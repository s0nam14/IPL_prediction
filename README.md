# IPL_prediction
A comparative analysis of different machine learning algorithms employed for modeling and predicting the results of IPL matches in the years, 2020-2024 will be outlined. The selected models consist of Logistic Regression, SVR, Random Forest, Decision Tree Regression, and LGBMClassifier. The performance of these models was then judged on the accuracy of the match that the models were able to predict. The models were trained and tested using IPL match data gathered within the given period. Analyzing the results, it can be seen that all models are different in their aspects, but LGBMClassifier scored higher in terms of predictive accuracy than the other models.
